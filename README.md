# Hockey Shooting Drill Feedback

Runtime: MediaPipe Pose + OpenCV + FFmpeg.
Enhanced form analysis: head position, upper body square, lower body triangle.
Agents: parent per-shot report, improvement coach sections (Gemini).

## Quick start (local)
1) Create a virtual environment and install deps you need for running agents locally:
```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install google-genai python-dotenv
```

2) Provide your Gemini key (one of):
```bash
echo "GOOGLE_API_KEY=YOUR_KEY" > .env     # preferred
# or
export GOOGLE_API_KEY=YOUR_KEY
```

3) Run agents against an existing analysis JSON:
```bash
python -m agents.improvement_coach_agent results/drill/kidshoot4_drill_feedback.json
python -m agents.parent_feedback_agent results/drill/kidshoot4_drill_feedback.json
```

To generate an analysis JSON from a local video, install analysis dependencies (see `worker/requirements.txt` for reference: mediapipe, opencv-python-headless, numpy, etc.) and run:
```bash
python -c "from analysis.shooting_drill_feedback import analyze_drill; import json; print(json.dumps(analyze_drill('videos/input/your_clip.mov'), indent=2))"
```

## Production Deployment
The backend API is deployed to Cloud Run and ready for production use:

**Backend API URL**: `https://puck-buddy-model-22317830094.us-central1.run.app`

### Available Endpoints:
- `GET /health` - Service health check
- `POST /api/upload-url` - Generate signed URL for video upload
- `POST /api/submit-video` - Create analysis job
- `POST /api/download-url` - Generate signed URL for file download
- `GET /api/results/{user_id}` - List user's analysis results

### Testing the deployment:
```bash
# Health check
curl https://puck-buddy-model-22317830094.us-central1.run.app/health

# Test signed URL generation (requires Firebase service account setup)
curl -X POST https://puck-buddy-model-22317830094.us-central1.run.app/api/upload-url \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"user_id":"test-user","filename":"test.mp4"}'
```

## Firebase Signed URL Integration
For complete app integration with secure video uploads and result delivery:

```bash
# Test complete signed URL workflow
cd tests
python3 test_complete_signed_url_workflow.py "test_user_123" "../videos/input/kidshoot2.MOV"
```

See `helpfuldocs/FIREBASE_SIGNED_URL_INTEGRATION.md` for complete integration guide.

## Cloud components
- **Backend API** (`signed_url_api.py`) deployed to Cloud Run provides signed URL endpoints
- **Worker services** (`worker/app_signed_urls.py`) handle video processing with signed URLs
- Firebase Functions (2nd gen) in `functions/` can enqueue jobs and clean old data
- Cloud Run handles video analysis via `analysis.analyze_drill` and agent summaries

## Docs
- See `helpfuldocs/HOCKEY_VIDEO_TESTING_GUIDE.md` for local testing tips.
- See `helpfuldocs/ARCHITECTURE.md` for end-to-end design.
