# Questions for Consideration: iOS App Integration

Before integrating your iOS app with the PuckBuddy video analysis service, please review these questions to ensure a smooth implementation and great user experience.

## üîê Authentication & User Management

**Current Setup:**
- [ ] Do you already have Firebase Auth integrated in your app?
- [ ] What sign-in methods do you support (email/password, Google, Apple ID, anonymous)?
- [ ] Do you have user profiles/onboarding flow already built?

**Considerations:**
- [ ] Should analysis results be tied to user accounts or allow anonymous usage?
- [ ] Do you need parental controls (parent approving child's video uploads)?
- [ ] Any age verification requirements for video analysis features?

## üì± App Architecture & Technical Stack

**Current Architecture:**
- [ ] Are you using SwiftUI or UIKit for your UI framework?
- [ ] What's your navigation pattern (TabView, NavigationStack, modal sheets)?
- [ ] Do you use any state management frameworks (Combine, Redux-like patterns)?
- [ ] What's your minimum iOS deployment target?

**Integration Approach:**
- [ ] Should video analysis be a core feature or secondary/premium feature?
- [ ] Do you want to integrate the provided `VideoAnalysisService` or build your own wrapper?
- [ ] Any existing video-related features that might conflict or integrate well?

## üé• Video Handling & Sources

**Video Sources:**
- [ ] Where will videos come from?
  - [ ] Live camera recording within your app
  - [ ] Photo library selection
  - [ ] External import (Files app, AirDrop, etc.)
  - [ ] Multiple sources

**Video Constraints:**
- [ ] What file size limits do you want to enforce? (Recommended: 100MB max)
- [ ] Any duration limits? (Recommended: 10 minutes max for cost control)
- [ ] Should you compress videos before upload? (Trade-off: quality vs. speed/cost)
- [ ] Do users need video preview/playback before submitting for analysis?

**Technical Considerations:**
- [ ] Do you have existing video recording/editing features?
- [ ] Any custom video filters or processing already in place?
- [ ] How do you handle video permissions (camera, photo library access)?

## üë§ User Experience & Flow

**Analysis Workflow:**
- [ ] Can users submit multiple videos simultaneously or one at a time?
- [ ] Should analysis happen immediately or allow users to queue multiple videos?
- [ ] How important is real-time progress vs. "submit and get notified later"?
- [ ] Should users be able to cancel in-progress analysis?

**Results Presentation:**
- [ ] Do you want both parent summary AND coaching feedback, or just one?
- [ ] Should results be saved locally for offline viewing?
- [ ] Any sharing features needed (export results, social sharing, email to coach)?
- [ ] How long should results remain accessible in the app?

**Error Handling:**
- [ ] How should you handle analysis failures (retry options, support contact)?
- [ ] What to do if video upload fails (retry, compression, size warning)?
- [ ] How to guide users when they submit unsuitable videos (wrong angle, too dark, etc.)?

## üì∂ Network & Performance

**Network Usage:**
- [ ] Should you warn users about data usage on cellular networks?
- [ ] Any preference for WiFi-only uploads?
- [ ] How do you handle network interruptions during upload?
- [ ] Should uploads be pausable/resumable?

**Performance Expectations:**
- [ ] What's acceptable upload time for users (30 seconds? 2 minutes?)?
- [ ] How long are users willing to wait for analysis results (5 minutes? 15 minutes?)?
- [ ] Any offline mode requirements?

## üí∞ Business & Cost Considerations

**Usage Patterns:**
- [ ] Expected number of users and videos per month?
- [ ] Is this B2C (parents/players) or B2B (coaches/teams)?
- [ ] Any seasonal usage spikes (tournament seasons, training camps)?
- [ ] Free tier limits vs. premium features?

**Cost Management:**
- [ ] Should you implement usage limits per user?
- [ ] Any subscription model that affects analysis quotas?
- [ ] How to handle cost scaling as user base grows?

## üîî Notifications & Background Processing

**Push Notifications:**
- [ ] Do you already have push notifications set up in your app?
- [ ] Should users get notified when analysis completes?
- [ ] Any preferences for notification timing (immediate, batched, quiet hours)?
- [ ] How should notification taps behave (deep link to results)?

**Background Behavior:**
- [ ] What happens if user closes app during upload/analysis?
- [ ] Should analysis continue in background or require foreground?
- [ ] How to handle app updates during pending analysis?

## üîí Privacy & Data Handling

**Video Privacy:**
- [ ] Are you comfortable with videos being temporarily stored on Google Cloud?
- [ ] Any requirements for video encryption or special handling?
- [ ] How long should videos be retained on the server? (Default: 24 hours)
- [ ] Any COPPA, GDPR, or other privacy regulations to consider?

**Data Usage:**
- [ ] Should analysis results be stored locally or only fetched when needed?
- [ ] Any analytics/tracking on analysis usage patterns?
- [ ] User consent flow for video analysis features?

## üìä Analytics & Monitoring

**Success Metrics:**
- [ ] How will you measure successful integrations?
- [ ] What user behavior do you want to track (completion rates, retry attempts)?
- [ ] Any custom analytics events needed for business intelligence?

**Error Monitoring:**
- [ ] How will you track and respond to integration issues?
- [ ] What level of error detail do you need for debugging?
- [ ] Any automated alerting for high failure rates?

## üöÄ Testing & Deployment

**Testing Strategy:**
- [ ] Do you have test videos of various qualities/angles for validation?
- [ ] How will you test the full flow end-to-end?
- [ ] Any beta testing group for the video analysis features?
- [ ] Device testing matrix (older iPhones, different iOS versions)?

**Rollout Plan:**
- [ ] Gradual rollout vs. full launch of video analysis features?
- [ ] Feature flagging for video analysis capabilities?
- [ ] Rollback plan if integration issues arise?

## üìà Future Considerations

**Scalability:**
- [ ] How might video analysis usage grow over time?
- [ ] Any plans for additional analysis types (different sports, skills)?
- [ ] Integration with other coaching/training tools?

**Feature Evolution:**
- [ ] Interest in real-time analysis (live video streams)?
- [ ] Multiple camera angles or comparison features?
- [ ] Coach/team dashboard features?

## Pre-Integration Checklist

Before starting development:

- [ ] Review all questions above and document decisions
- [ ] Verify Firebase project setup and permissions
- [ ] Test video upload/storage with sample files
- [ ] Confirm backend services are deployed and working
- [ ] Plan user onboarding flow for new video analysis features
- [ ] Set up error monitoring and analytics
- [ ] Create test plan with various video scenarios
- [ ] Design user interface mockups for analysis flow
- [ ] Consider App Store review implications for new video features

## Getting Help

If any of these questions reveal complexity you hadn't considered:

1. **Technical Integration**: Refer to `IOS_INTEGRATION.md` for implementation details
2. **Backend Issues**: Check `ARCHITECTURE.md` for service design
3. **Custom Requirements**: Consider if the current service needs modifications
4. **Business Logic**: You may need additional Firebase Functions for custom workflows

Taking time to think through these questions upfront will save significant development time and help ensure a smooth user experience.
